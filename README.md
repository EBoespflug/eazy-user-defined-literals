Provides multiple user-defined literals and preprocessor macro tools for easy creation of straightforward user-defined literals.

## Overview

## Installation

This library is header-only. To use it, simply include needed header files in your source files.

The library is constituted in two main parts:
 - The EZL library: providing function macro to generate user-defined literals.
 - The EZL examples (situated in the src/examples subfolder): including an usage example of the EZL library. The header files thus provides user-defined literals for various domains (int literals, gmp literals, Qt string literals) and can be used in a project. Between, the inclusion of an example header file require the presence of the EZL library headers to compile.
